# URLShortenerAPI
### This is a HTTP Service for creating short url 

@author Mihai Timbota-Belin 

@version 1.0.1

## Installation

TL;DR - just show me how to install and run the code. Fork or clone the code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mihai22125/URLShortenerAPI.git
```

Build the code from the root directory

```bash
go build -o server
```

> This sends the output of `go build` to a file called `server` in the same directory.

Execute the file

```bash
./server
```

You should see something similar to the following:

```bash
$ ./server
url-api2021/02/02 15:27:53 Starting server on port  :8080
```

## Documentation

Documentation can be accessed by typing ```localhost:8080/docs``` in your browser after running the server.
